<h3>Some exercises include weights. These are optional, and can be anything (dumbbell, water bottle, can of beans)</h3>
<h3>Go at your own pace, even if it's slower than the people on screen</h3>
<h3>If something aches at the end, stretch it, don't <i>just</i> go by what's in the cooldown video</h3>
